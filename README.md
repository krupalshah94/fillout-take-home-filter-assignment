# ExpressJS and TypeScript API Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the ExpressJS and TypeScript API:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Execute `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Install webpack-cli as a development dependency by running `npm install --save-dev webpack-cli`.
4. Create a `.env` file using the provided `.env.sample` as a template.
5. Start the server with `npm start`.
6. Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser to interact with the API.
7. For production, build the project using `npm run build:prod`.
8. Serve the production build with `npm run prod`.

Now you have a fully set up ExpressJS and TypeScript API. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth development and production experience.


# Updated ExpressJS and TypeScript API Directory Structure

After following the setup instructions, your project directory structure should be organized as follows:

```
- dist/
  - index.js
- node_modules/
- src/
  - config/
    - index.ts
  - dto/
    - dto.ts
  - logger/
    - index.ts
  - routes/
    - index.ts
  - services/
    - xyz.service.ts
  - index.ts
- .env
- .env.sample
- .gitignore
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- readme
- tsconfig.json
- tslint.json
- webpack.config.js
```

Explanation of key directories and files:

- **dist/**: The directory containing compiled and bundled JavaScript files. The `index.js` file serves as the entry point for your application in production.

- **node_modules/**: Node.js modules installed via `npm install`. This directory is generated by npm and contains the packages your project depends on.

- **src/**: The source code of your ExpressJS and TypeScript API.

  - **config/**: Configuration files for your application, with `index.ts` as the main configuration file.

  - **dto/**: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for your application, with a file named `dto.ts`.

  - **logger/**: A directory for your application's logging functionality, with `index.ts` as the main logging file.

  - **routes/**: The directory where you define your API routes, with `index.ts` as the main routes file.

  - **services/**: The directory for service files, with `xyz.service.ts` as an example service file.

  - **index.ts**: The main application file where you configure and initialize your ExpressJS app.

- **.env**: Your environment configuration file, which you need to create based on the provided `.env.sample`.

- **.env.sample**: A sample configuration file to help you create your own `.env` file.

- **.gitignore**: A file specifying patterns of files that should be ignored by Git. Commonly includes `node_modules/` and `dist/` to avoid versioning large or generated files.

- **package.json**: The npm package file where you define your project's dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.

- **package-lock.json**: A file that is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree or `package.json`.

- **readme**: Your project's readme file, providing essential information on how to set up and run the project.

- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file, specifying how TypeScript should compile your code.

- **tslint.json**: A configuration file for TSLint, a tool that checks your TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors.

- **webpack.config.js**: Configuration file for Webpack, a module bundler. Used to bundle and optimize your TypeScript code for production.

Ensure your project adheres to this structure for a well-organized ExpressJS and TypeScript API setup. Adjustments can be made based on your specific project requirements.

### Route Registration

The `register` function exports a route registration logic that can be integrated into an Express application. This route is designed to handle GET requests for filtered responses based on a specified form ID. The route extracts query parameters such as filters, page, and pageSize, fetches form submission data from an external API using the `ApiService`, applies filters, paginates the result, and sends back the filtered and paginated data as a JSON response.

### ApiService Class

#### Fetching Form Submission Data

The `ApiService` class provides methods for interacting with an external API:

- **fetchFormSubmissionData(options):** Asynchronously fetches form submission data from the external API. It supports optional request customization through headers and query parameters.

#### Filtering and Pagination

- **filterResponses(response, filters, pageOptions):** Applies specified filter criteria to the fetched form submission data and returns a paginated response. It uses a variety of filter conditions such as Equals, DoesNotEqual, GreaterThan, and LessThan. The filtered data is then paginated for efficient handling of large datasets.

- **paginatedResponse(pageOptions, flatFilteredResponses):** Implements pagination logic based on page and pageSize parameters. It calculates the appropriate start and end indices to extract a subset of the filtered responses, returning a paginated response containing the filtered form submission data.

### Error Handling

The route and ApiService include error handling to log errors using the provided `logger` and return appropriate error responses (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

### Configuration

The application relies on configuration files (`envConfig`, `.env`) to manage environment-specific settings such as API endpoints and tokens.

### Overall Flow

1. **Route Registration:** The `register` function sets up an Express route to handle GET requests for filtered form submission data.

2. **ApiService:** The `ApiService` class abstracts the interaction with the external API, providing methods for fetching, filtering, and paginating form submission data.

3. **Filtering and Pagination:** The route extracts query parameters, fetches data, applies filters, and paginates the results using the `ApiService`.

4. **Error Handling:** Both the route and `ApiService` include error handling to log and respond to errors appropriately.

This ExpressJS and TypeScript API aims to provide a flexible and efficient solution for fetching and handling large datasets of form submission data based on specified filter criteria. Adjustments and enhancements can be made based on specific project requirements.
